-Translate wrench at arbitrary joint into torque commands
   -Get r vector from forward kinematics and get equivalent wrench (base frame)
-Right and left arm
-Test switching from torque control to position control
-Safety mechanism node
-Record trajectory and replay it with torque control
-Stiffness/Damping parameter tuning
-Control vs reaction switching (show separately for midterm)
