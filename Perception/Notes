The dependencies should all be installed.

1. Run the freenect command found in the Baxter Kinect tutorial
2. Run SAC.launch to get downsampled voxels
3. Run MoveIt/Rviz/whatever and /voxel_grid/output is the topic; it should automatically have a tf to camera_link so when camera_link is tf'd, it will move as well
